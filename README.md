# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

## Overview

This project uses Spotify's dataset to predict song popularity from their audio features. Employing machine learning models, it explores how attributes like danceability, energy, and tempo impact a song's success. The insights can help in creating music that resonates widely.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with analysis and model building.
- `data/`: Dataset used in the project.
- `images/`: Images and graphs for the README.

## Getting Started

This project is designed to be run in Google Colab, a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.

### Running the Notebook

1. Upload the `Song_Popularity_Prediction.ipynb` notebook to Google Colab.
2. Upload the `SpotifyFeatures.csv` dataset to the Colab notebook environment using the file upload feature.
3. You can now run the notebook cells to perform the analysis and view the results.

## Dataset

The `SpotifyFeatures.csv` dataset contains audio features of songs from Spotify, including attributes like danceability, energy, key, loudness, and tempo.

## Models and Analysis

The project explores machine learning models to predict song popularity, focusing on linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The notebook discusses model performance, accuracy metrics, and feature importance, providing insights into factors influencing song popularity on Spotify. You can view the results of the analysis in the [Results](Results/Song_Popularity_Prediction_Results.md) file (replace with path if the results are in a separate file).

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project! You can add features, improve models, or enhance the analysis. Just fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
